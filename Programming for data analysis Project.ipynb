    "The working/hours data set simulation has been generated using the normal distribution. We assume for this study that the company has the same working/hours policy for all employees. We assume that the policy is to work 7h per day. Then the distribution will follow a bell shape where most of the values will be close to 7. The mean for this random normal distribution is 7h, the standar deviation 0.5 as we assume that the employees follow the company policy and they doesn't vary much the time they spend at work: 30 min would be the usual deviation."
